Hello! Welcome to our Github Repository! This repository is our submission for the NUS-ISS Digital Futurist Challenge
under the **Health & Well-Being** Category.  

Chrysanthemum aims to redefine the old standards of technology as the technology landscape evolves, making health data
more secure. The Chrysanthemum Suite consists of **Chrysanthemum**, Blockchain System where the data will be stored and accessed, 
and **MyHealth**, the Mobile Application that is used in conjuction with each other. This is achieved through implementation of 
**Web 3.0** technologies and using robust encryption standards to make health data more resistant to information breaches. As a 
whole, we hope that the Chrysanthemum Suite is able to give people a greater control over their personal information and allow 
users to have a greater quality of life through providing vital health data and improving the general healthcare experience.
